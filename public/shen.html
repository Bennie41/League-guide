    <td>Try to bait out his Q’s by stutter stepping close to him and backing out, and then do the extended trade* when they’ve run out, and make sure to block his passive-Auto with your W. Be very careful about him running you down in an extended trade with R after lvl 6 though.</td>

    <td>Akali</td>
    <td>Challenging</td>
    <td>Utilize your passive shield to block some of her Q poke and only go in for trades once she's used up most of her energy for poke/push. Her shroud is 2 seconds longer CD than your lvl 1 E, so use that 2 sec window if she walks close when  your taunt gets up after an fW if it’s up. Try to look for extended trades pre 6, because after 6 she will just hunt you down unless you’re MUCH healthier than her at the start of the trade.</td>
